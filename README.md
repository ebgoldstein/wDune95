# wDune95
This is a Python version of the classic Werner 1995 cellular dune model. I used 2 papers to write the model:

1) Werner BT. 1995. Eolian dunes: computer simulation and attractor interpretation. Geology 23: 1107–1110.

and

2) Momiji H, Carretero-Gonzalez R, Bishop SR, Warren A. 2000. Simulation of the effect of wind speedup in the formation of transverse dune
fields. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms 25: 905–918.

additional insight (not yet incorporated) can be gleaned from many subsequent papers....

Eventually I should vectorize the code to get rid of the basic 'looping' construction.
(with `np.roll`, `np.unravel`, etc..)
