# wDune95
This is a Python version of the classic Werner 1995 cellular dune model. I used 2 papers to write the model:

1) Werner BT. 1995. Eolian dunes: computer simulation and attractor interpretation. Geology 23: 1107–1110.

and

2) Momiji H, Carretero-Gonzalez R, Bishop SR, Warren A. 2000. Simulation of the effect of wind speedup in the formation of transverse dune
fields. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms 25: 905–918.

additional insight (not yet incorporated) can be gleaned from mamny subsequent papers....

The goal of this model was for me to learn Python, and eventually to look for vectorizations to get rid of the basic 'looping' construction.
I have yet to do this, but including `np.roll`, `np.unravel`, etc..
